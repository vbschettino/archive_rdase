# ROS Description And Simulation Examples
This repository contains packages with different approaches to robot description (for visualisation in RVIZ for example) and simulation (in gazebo). Each package represents a different implementation of a 4-wheeled mobile vehicle.

The rdase metapackage is used to summarize all the dependencies.
